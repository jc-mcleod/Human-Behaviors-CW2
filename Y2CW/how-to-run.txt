The scripts will use Python 3's built-in module http.server to run a local webserver which will then be accessible within the browser. 
Python comes by default on most Linux distributions. If Python 3 is not installed on your system, you can install it following the instructions below.

Windows:
Download the Windows installer (64-bit) from the link below:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/

When installing, ensure the "Add to PATH" option is checked.
